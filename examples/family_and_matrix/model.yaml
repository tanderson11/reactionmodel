# families let us write many species and reactions
# that formulaically involve sets:
families:
  As: [x, y, z]
  Bs: [p, q, r]

species:
# a different species for every member of the As family
- name: 'A_$i'
  used_families: {'i': 'As'}
# a different species for every member of the Bs family
- name: 'B_$j'
  used_families: {'j': 'Bs'}

reactions:
# a reaction 2A_i => B_j for all combinations of i,j in As x Bs
- description: 2A_$i => B_$j
  reactants: [['A_$i', 2]] # 2 A_i
  products: ['B_$j']
  # matrix Q is defined in parameters.yaml. `#i` gives the index of member i in the family
  k: 'Q[#i][#j]' 
  used_families: {'i': 'As', 'j': 'Bs'}
